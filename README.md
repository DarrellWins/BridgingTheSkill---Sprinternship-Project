Darrell Cox Jr. Sprinternship Project 

This project will create a mock program that will allow the user to transition their life experiences into a resume like format. 
The user will put their basic information in and with their work experiences. 
Afterwards, the program will add action verbs, proper capitilzation, and format bullet points, similar to that of a resume.
